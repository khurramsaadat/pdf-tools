# Shadcn/UI Migration Status

## Current Status: Phase 1 Complete ✅

### What's Done:
1. ✅ shadcn/ui installed and configured
2. ✅ Base components installed (button, card, input, dropdown-menu, separator)
3. ✅ Tailwind config updated for shadcn
4. ✅ app/globals.css updated with shadcn CSS variables
5. ✅ app/layout.tsx updated to use shadcn theme tokens
6. ✅ All changes tested and working
7. ✅ Pushed to GitHub

### Test Results:
- ✅ Homepage loads correctly
- ✅ Dark theme maintained
- ✅ No major errors in console
- ✅ Existing functionality preserved

### Next Steps (If continuing migration):
1. Gradually migrate individual components to use shadcn components
2. Update buttons, inputs, cards throughout the application
3. Maintain existing design and functionality
4. Test with Playwright after each change

### Current Decision:
The existing custom dropdown implementation in Navbar works perfectly and provides a better UX than shadcn's dropdown. Since shadcn is primarily a design system and the site already has excellent styling, **further migration may not be necessary**.

### Recommendation:
**Pause migration** unless specific shadcn components are needed. The current implementation is:
- Fast and responsive
- Well-styled with dark theme
- Mobile-friendly
- Fully functional
